Before running this, make sure you have created the Topic page_visits. From the command line:
bin/kafka-create-topic.sh --topic page_visits --replica 3 --zookeeper localhost:2181 --partition 5
Make sure you include a --partition option so you create more than one.
Now compile and run your Producer and data will be written to Kafka.
To confirm you have data, use the command line tool to see what was written:
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic page_visits --from-beginning


For example you want to:
Read a message multiple times
Consume only a subset of the partitions in a topic in a process
Manage transactions to make sure a message is processed once and only once
Downsides of using SimpleConsumer
The SimpleConsumer does require a significant amount of work not needed in the Consumer Groups:
You must keep track of the offsets in your application to know where you left off consuming.
You must figure out which Broker is the lead Broker for a topic and partition
You must handle Broker leader changes
